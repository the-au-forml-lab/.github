The ForML (<mark>For</mark>mal <mark>M</mark>ethods and Computational <mark>L</mark>ogic) Lab 
at [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu) strives to advance the software
development process by using the principles and techniques from
logic, mathematics, and interactive theorem proving to
ensure the correctness and security of software.
The primary research areas of the faculty and students in the ForML
lab are: foundations of programming languages, interactive theorem
proving, categorical logic, reversible computing, program optimization, 
program analysis and secure programming.

**Research**

* [Concurrency In Reversible Computations](https://github.com/CinRC)
* [Static Analyses of Program Flows](https://github.com/statycc)


**Events and Activities**

* The Southeast Regional Programming Languages Seminar: [2023](https://the-au-forml-lab.github.io/SERPL/events/2023/) and [2019](https://the-au-forml-lab.github.io/SERPL2019/)  
* The weekly [programming languages reading group](https://the-au-forml-lab.github.io/plgroup/)
* [ΔΛΔ student organization](https://augusta.presence.io/organization/delta-lambda-delta)
  is dedicated to students interested in related research topics

The lab members also support the Augusta University community by crafting and maintaining various document templates, like 
the [AU SCCS letterhead](https://github.com/the-au-forml-lab/au_ccs_letterhead_template) and
graduate [dissertation template](https://github.com/the-au-forml-lab/au_ccs_dissertation_template).
