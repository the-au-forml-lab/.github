The ForML (<mark>For</mark>mal <mark>M</mark>ethods and Computational <mark>L</mark>ogic) Lab 
is broadly the collective of faculty and students at [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu) that strive
to ensure the correctness and security of software by using principles from logic, mathematics, and formal methods.
The primary research areas of the faculty and students are: foundations of programming languages, interactive theorem
proving, categorical logic, reversible computing, program optimization, program analysis, and secure programming.
